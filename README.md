Things I learnt and skills I built on through building this app:
State Management: Gained better understanding of state management in React applications, using hooks like useState and useReducer, to handle user inputs and message storage.

Decentralization: Leveraged Gun.js to implement a decentralized database for message storage and retrieval, emphasizing the application's scalability and robustness.

Real-time Updates: Implemented real-time updates using Gun.js's .map().once() functionality for immediate rendering of new messages.

Efficient Data Handling: Implemented an efficient data handling strategy to filter out duplicate messages.

UI Development: Developed an intuitive user interface using Bootstrap classes for better user experience.
